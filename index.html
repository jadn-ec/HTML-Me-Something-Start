                    Missouri River Runner is a famous passenger line that allows 
                    transportation between Kansas City MO and St Louis Mo via rail. Amtrak is the nations only Class 1 passenger rail line and does not “own” any tracks but utilizes ansystem known as “host roads.” Sometimes smaller companies, or lines that are provided by the Government will borrow track time from larger groups. Amtrak in St. Louis utilizes BNSF’s tracks often as they have a large operation in South City.  The river runner was

Find a schedule. Find a railroad/ locomotive you enjoy and follow their schedule.
 Some rails are not rail friendly and do not post their schedules.
  Fortunately, some engineers spill secrets about schedules and destinations they are passing through. 
  These locomotives are more rare and are always a delight to catch! If you ever desire to see the nations largest and 
  heaviest locomotive..check out this
